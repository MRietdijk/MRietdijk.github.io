<h2>IDF-basics</h2>
<p>When I was working on a project for school. I needed to work with the Arduino framework.
    The Arduino framework is a good framework for beginners, but if you use it on a big project, it will break at some point.
    That was the reason that i wanted to checkout the IDF library. I had heard in the school course that the Arduino's use a microchip called Atmega 328p. This microprocessor uses the AVRlib.
    This is a framework different than the Arduino framework. This framework was also more difficult to learn. So for my own projects i wanted to learn the framework for the ESP32 WROOM.
</p>

<p>
    The ESP32 WROOM is from a company called Espressif. The developers at Espressif made a framework called IDF (IoT Development Framework). This is a framework for the microprocessor like AVRlib.

<h3>What is this document about</h3>

<p>In this document I will program a basic program on the ESP32 with the IDF framework. This will be used in a futher project of mine.</p>

<h3>Basic Hello world</h3>

<p>For a noob in IDF, it is always good to start with printing "Hello world" over the Serial-bus.
    With that in mind i wanted to take a look how to make a standard program.
</p>

<p>If you start a project in PlatformIO with the IDF framework, you get the following code for free.</p>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">void app_main() {

}</code>
